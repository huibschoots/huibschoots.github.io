Happy New Year. 2013 promises to become a great year… Hope it does for you as well! I have some interesting and exciting plans for this year, hope to blog about those later.

I will be speaking at least 5 conferences in 2013 and hope to blog more as I did last year. “My 2012 in blogging” report tells me I had almost 10.000 visits on my blog, so thank you for reading and discussing testing on this blog!

Looking back at 2012 it brought me a lot of good things: being speaker at 10 conferences, co-writing a book, a new job, learned a boat load of new stuff, met many new interesting people, had a great holiday in the USA, simply too much to mention. Let’s make 2013 a truly fantastic year together!

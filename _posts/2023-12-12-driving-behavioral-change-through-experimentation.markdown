In my previous blog, I wrote about “[The three essential elements for successful software - people, process and technology](/posts/the-three-essential-elements-for-successful-software){:target="_blank"}.” I also referenced Leandro Herrero’s Viral Change. Herrero argues that systems account for about one-third of an organization’s success, while behavior determines the other two-thirds. If we want to succeed, our primary focus must be on people’s behavior!

But how do you ensure that the behavior within your team actually makes the team successful? Before we can answer that, let’s take a closer look at behavior itself. What is it? And how is it shaped?

### What is Behavior?

For a clear definition, I turn to the book [50 veranderprincipes](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/50-veranderprincipes/9200000101843579){:target="_blank"} (in English: 50 Change Principles): "Behavior is everything we do or refrain from doing, consciously or unconsciously, that can be observed". There are two types of behavior: conscious and unconscious. Only about 5% of our behavior is conscious, meaning the remaining 95% happens unconsciously. In other words, the vast majority of our actions occur without us even thinking about them.

### Where Does Behavior Come From?

So what shapes the way we act? Part of it comes from our genetic predisposition: our innate wiring. But experiences also have a major influence on behavior. Experiences shape what we believe (our convictions), and those beliefs shape our thoughts. Finally, those thoughts influence how we behave.

Behavior typically follows a cycle:
- A trigger sets it in motion.
- The behavior is displayed.
- A consequence follows—an outcome or a feeling.
- That consequence then becomes a new experience, feeding back into the cycle.

### Changing Behavior

Trying to convince people to behave differently usually doesn’t work. Yet that’s exactly what we see around us every day—in TV debates, in workplace meetings, and in countless arguments. People try to win each other over with reasoning, but persuasion rarely changes behavior.

What does work is giving people new experiences. How we feel after doing something differently is a strong predictor of whether we’ll repeat it. People are sensitive to the consequences of their actions. If they feel good about a new behavior—or if it proves beneficial—they’re more likely to repeat it, and that’s how real change takes hold.

In agile teams, a Scrum Master or coach can use this principle effectively. For example, they might suggest experimenting with risk analysis during refinement sessions for a few sprints. If it doesn’t work, the team can simply drop it. By framing change as an experiment, teams are far more open to trying something new.

Another powerful approach is reinforcing effective behavior until it becomes habit. Habits then move into the 95% of unconscious behavior, creating sustainable improvement. Recognizing triggers is also essential. By spotting them early, teams can prevent unhelpful behavior and choose a more constructive response.

### What Doesn’t Help

Behavioral change is difficult, it doesn’t happen automatically. If people don’t see the need or benefit, nothing will change. Persuasion rarely works, especially when the “not invented here” syndrome kicks in. Humans dislike loss, discomfort, and pain. If change threatens to cause discomfort, resistance is natural. The greater the discomfort, the stronger the resistance. From an evolutionary perspective, the unknown equals potential danger. Our brains also struggle with making mistakes, even though failure is an essential part of learning.

The environment matters, too. People are heavily influenced by those around them. When the environment reacts positively and models the same behavior, individuals are far more likely to adopt it themselves. Conversely, focusing too much on resistance is counterproductive. Because what you give attention to, grows.

### Time to Take Action!

Yes, change is hard. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. In fact, knowing that behavior has the greatest impact on team and organizational performance makes it too important to ignore. So what can we do? Create safety for people to try new things. Leaders should model the desired behavior. Ensure consistent messaging from management. Communicate openly and transparently, using stories rather than arguments to inspire motivation. Focus on the willing. Work with those ready to experiment and build new experiences with them. Above all: do more, talk less. Change takes time. Behaviors that have been ingrained for years won’t shift overnight, it often takes months of consistent practice to make change stick. That’s why patience and persistence are essential. Everything can change—if we’re willing to keep at it.

Good luck!

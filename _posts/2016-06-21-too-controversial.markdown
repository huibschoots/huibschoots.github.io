On May 11 2016 [TestNet](https://www.testnet.org/){:target="_blank"} held her spring conference with ‚ÄúStrengthen your foundation: new skills for testers‚Äù as the central theme. They claim on their website: _"TestNet is a network of, by and for testers. TestNet offers its members the opportunity to maintain contacts with other testers outside the immediate work environment and share knowledge and experiences from the field."_ The call for papers that was send out made me frown. It said:

>‚ÄúIn the final keynote of the TestNet autumn event, speaker Rini van Solingen referred to the end of software testing as we know it. ‚ÄòWhat one can learn in merely four weeks, does not deserve to be called a profession‚Äô, he stated. But is that true? Most of our skills, we learn on the job. There are many tools, techniques, skills, hints and methods not typical for the testing profession but essential for enabling us to do a good job nonetheless. Furthermore the testing profession is constantly evolving as a result of ICT and business trends. Not only functional testing, but also performance, security or other test varieties. This presses us to expand our knowledge, not just the testing skills, but also of the contexts in which we do our jobs. The TestNet Spring Event 2016 is about all topics that are not addressed in our basic testing course, but enable us to do a better job: knowledge, skills, experience."

I think that there are a lot of skills that are not addressed in our ‚Äúbasic testing course‚Äù where they should have been addressed. I am talking about basic testing skills! So I wrote an abstract for a keynote for the conference:

<code style="color : lightskyblue">The theme for the spring event is ‚ÄúStrengthen your foundation: new skills for testers‚Äù. My story takes a step back: to the foundation! Because I think that the foundation of most testers is not as good as they think. The title would then be: ‚ÄúNew skills for testers: back to basics!‚Äú

<code style="color : lightskyblue">Professional testers are able to tell a successful story about their work. They can cite activities and come up with a thorough overview of the skills they use. They are able to explain what they do and why. they can report progress, risk and coverage at any time. They will gladly explain what oracles and heuristics they use, know everything about the product they are testing and are deliberately trying to learn continuously.

<code style="color : lightskyblue">It surprises me that testers regularly can‚Äôt give a proper definition of testing. Let alone that they are able to describe what testing is. A large majority of people who call themselves professional testers can not explain what they do when they are testing. How can anyone take a tester seriously if he/she can not explain what he/she is doing all day? Try it: go to one of your testing colleagues and ask what he or she is doing and why it contributes to the mission of the project. Nine out of ten testers I‚Äôve asked this simple question, start to stutter.

<code style="color : lightskyblue">What do you exactly do if you use a ‚Äúdata combination test‚Äù or a ‚Äúdecision table‚Äù? What skills do you use? ‚ÄúCommon sense‚Äù in this context does not answer the question because it is not a skill, is it? I think of: modeling, critical thinking, learning, combine, observe, reasoning, drawing conclusions just to name a few. By looking in detail at what skills you are actually using, helps you recognize which skills you could/should train. A solid foundation is essential to build on it in the future!

<code style="color : lightskyblue">How can you learn the right skills if you do not know what skills you are using in the first place? In this presentation I will take the audience back to the core of our business: skills! By recognizing the skills and training them, we are able to think of and talk about our profession with confidence. The ultimate goal is to tell a good story about why we test and value it adds.

<code style="color : lightskyblue">We need a solid foundation to build on!</code>

My keynote wasn‚Äôt selected. So I send it in as a normal session, since I really am bothered by the lack of insight in our community. But it didn‚Äôt make it on the conference program as a normal session either. Why?  Because it is too controversial they told me. After applying for the keynote the chairman called me to tell me that they weren‚Äôt going to ask me to do a keynote because the did want a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù sound on stage. I guess I can imagine that you do not want to start the day with a keynote who destroys your theme by saying that we need to strengthen our foundation first before moving on.

But why is this story too controversial for the conference at all? I guess it is (at least in the eyes of the program committee) because we don‚Äôt like to admit that we lack skills. That we don‚Äôt really know how to explain testing. I wrote about that before in my blog "[Why testers are not taken seriously‚Ä¶](https://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=2323){:target="_blank"}". It bothers me that we think our foundation is good enough, while it really isn‚Äôt! We need to up our game and being nice and ignoring this problem isn‚Äôt going to help us. A soft and nice approach doesn‚Äôt wake people up. That is why I wanted to shake this up a bit. To wake people up and give them some serious feedback ‚Ä¶ I wrote about serious feedback before in my blog "[Stop hugging, start working ‚Ä¶ on excellence!](https://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=1945){:target="_blank"}". But the Dutch Testing Community (represented by TestNet) finds my ideas too controversial‚Ä¶

>Huib, obviously in this case TestNet did not:
1. Give you an opportunity to maintain contact with other testers
2. Share knowledge & experience

This is the third and last part on the theme “How to become a software testing expert.” Part 1 “You can learn testing!”
can be found [here](/posts/you-can-learn-testing){:target="_blank"} and Part 2 “What makes a good tester?” is
[here](/posts/what-makes-a-good-tester){:target="_blank"}.

<blockquote class="prompt-info">This blog post was originally written as a column for Testtnewsonline (English) and Testnieuws (Dutch).</blockquote>

In part one I said that if you want to be an expert software tester, you must qualify yourself in many skills. That
through feedback, actively seeking and making mistakes, helps you find out where you can improve. And that coaching is a
great way to learn faster. In part two I stated that passion and attitude are most important. Then the skills,
competencies and qualities such as proactivity, communication, social / emotional development, collaboration, fast
learning, curiosity, but also the ability to apply test techniques. Knowledge to me is the least important. A good
tester has test, technical and domain knowledge (in that order of importance).

## Passion and attitude

Without passion no change and no progress said Ferry Bezem of Twynstra Gudde in his article ("Passie voor je werk is
besmettelijk" which is no longer online).
“[How passion for your job can lead to success](https://itmanagersinbox.com/1559/how-passion-for-your-job-can-lead-to-success/){:target="_blank"}"
is one of the other many articles I found when I googled “passion in your work”. To become succesfull, you need to find
out who you are and where you get energy. To become good, you need to have passion for your profession.
[This article](https://www.personal-development.com/chuck/passion.htm){:target="_blank"} explains how to “develop”
passion. In addition attitude or mentality are important as well. With the right attitude, you will be successful for
sure! And don’t forget: you can change your attitude!

## Critical thinking

Testing for me is questioning a product in order to evaluate it. A tester does this by learning everything there is to
learn about the product and [analyze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis){:target="_blank"} this information.
[Critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking){:target="_blank"} is an essential competency of a
tester. But how many testers train it? On a well known Dutch book site I searched for books on critical thinking. What
struck me was that there are several books on critical thinking for medical personal to find. And that sounds actually
quite logical: medics diagnose patients, testers do the same for their “patients”: the test object!

## Waste

We write comprehensive test plans that are never read. We use extensive templates to make sure nothing is forgotten (and
we do not have to think too much). We do product risk assessments but subsequently we don’t do anything with the risks
identified. We often do not use any test techniques. Why?! I think because many people simply don’t know how. I often
ask why test techniques are not used. The most common answer is: because there is not enough time!? But these techniques
should make our testing more effective and efficient, don’t they? As a tester you should be dreaming these techniques.
You should OWN them!

## Adaptive?

Every novice tester in the Netherlands starts with TMap or ISTQB. With that fact in itself is nothing wrong. A three-day
class where the basics of software testing are taught is a good start. But too often that’s it. We like to guide our
testing with process models: ISTQB and TMAP are full of them. But the reality is often more complex and testers get in
trouble when the situation is slightly different as they are used to. The choice of a particular tool, technique or
method depends on the [context](https://www.context-driven-testing.com/){:target="_blank"}. TMap Next claims to be an
adaptive method, but do you remember how much time was spent on this topic in your class? And how adaptive are you
yourself? Do you use the same template over and over? Do you simply copy the test plan for the next release using a
search and replace?

## Learn, practice and training

I learned very much by critical reading. There are many
[free software test magazines](https://simonsaysnomore.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/free-magazines/){:target="_blank"} and
there are many great books on software testing. The internet is an excellent source of (often free) information. There
are many videos available of presentations at meetings and conferences. On my blog I keep a list of
[great resources](/posts/great-resources){:target="_blank"} for testers. Lynn McKee has a
[similar list](https://www.qualityperspectives.ca/resources/){:target="_blank"}. Or start reading blogs,
[twitter or X now](https://www.practitest.com/resource-center/blog/top-20-twitter-influencers/){:target="_blank"} can
inform you about new interesting blogs and other things worth reading.

Try [weekend testing](https://weekendtesting.com/){:target="_blank"} or a
[testing dojo](https://www.shino.de/2010/04/16/testing-dojos/){:target="_blank"} to practice your skills. Join a local
software test community or organize your own gathering with a group of testers who want to meet and learn. At several
employers I introduced intervision meetings for testers. I also founded
[DEWT](https://dewt.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} with a group of passionate colleagues: like-minded people who like
to challenge and inspire each other. We spend many hours discussing our profession and we certainly do not always agree.
We discuss and practice in a safe environment and learn from each other.

## Try something different

Have you been a software tester for years and are you planning to spice up your resume with another certificate? Then
maybe the [BBST training](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/training/courses/foundations/){:target="_blank"}
is something for you. Let me warn you in advance: this training will give you no certificate and it requires you to
study and do exercises almost daily for a month. If you really want to learn, you need to invest a lot of time. Malcolm
Gladwell claims in his book [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29){:target="_blank"} that the key
to success in any field is practicing 10,000 hours. Try a training that changes your view on testing:
[Rapid Software Testing](https://www.rapid-software-testing.com){:target="_blank"} for example. This training has
changed my view of my profession and [inspired me](https://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=86) tremendously. Visiting
[conferences](https://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=263) can be very inspiring and instructive. Join
[TestNet](https://www.testnet.org/){:target="_blank"} or another (online) testing community like
[Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/){:target="_blank"} and get inspired. You have plenty of choice!

## Learning from others

I enjoy working with others. As I observe, I ask questions or explain my view on the situation. We still can learn a lot
from our colleagues in projects … and vice versa! And I’m not just talking about fellow testers. A programmer can build
a tool or script in only a few hours that can save testers days of work. By doing unit tests together, we gain insight
in what developers test and how they do it. Try working together:
[pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming){:target="_blank"} or
[pair testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_testing){:target="_blank"} can be a powerful tool. Unfortunately, it
has a negative image, because it seems to double the effort. But I think it can be beneficial. The added value is
mastering the details of a job easier, fewer mistakes, faster learning, team building, cooperation and fun.

## Writing and presenting

Blogging, writing columns or giving presentations forces you to structure your thoughts. In addition, your stories or
presentations will trigger reactions by others. By taking this feedback seriously, can you sharpen your thoughts and
learn again.

## Finally

Ask yourself what you can do better often. Evaluate! Ask for reviews on your products regulary. Also ask for feedback
from your colleagues on the process, your skills and your performance proactively. Furthermore, my advice is simple: you
need a lot of practice to become an expert. So what are you going to do tomorrow?

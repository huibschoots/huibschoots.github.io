### Rapid Software Testing Reading List

<blockquote class="prompt-info">If you took an RST class or read the book, here are some additional materials that would be good for you to survey.
</blockquote>

# RST Appendices & learn more
-   [RST Appendices](https://www.satisfice.com/download/rst-appendices){:target="_blank"} is full of (sometimes old but still useful) examples and articles. Don’t read all of it, find what is useful for you.
-   The "[Learn more](https://rapid-software-testing.com/learn_more/){:target="_blank"}" section on the RST website

# RST classics
-   [Heuristic Test Strategy Model](https://www.satisfice.com/download/heuristic-test-strategy-model){:target="_blank"}<br>
    This document is included in the RST Appendices. Even if you choose to read nothing else, do have a look at this.

-   [Exploratory Testing 3.0](https://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/1509){:target="_blank"}<br> The way you think of
    exploratory testing might not be the way we think of it. Here's how we think and talk about exploratory testing in
    Rapid Software Testing — and why we're considering not talking about it.

-   [Testing and Checking Refined](https://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856){:target="_blank"}<br> There's a big
    difference between testing — learning about a product through experiencing, exploring, and experimenting — and
    checking, which is a part of testing that can be automated.<br> Joep Schuurkes view on this:
    [What’s the word for the part of testing that’s not checking?](https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2015/whats-the-word-for-the-part-of-testing-thats-not-checking/){:target="_blank"}

-   Test cases are not testing: towards a culture of test performance<br>This article talks about testing as a
    performance. Giving great insights in why testing is so much more then test cases. It helps you get rid of the test
    cases addiction. [Article](https://www.satisfice.com/download/test-cases-are-not-testing){:target="_blank"} &
    [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLVP_Z5AoyM){:target="_blank"}

- The Premises of Rapid Software Testing Rapid Software Testing is based on several premises that relate to the general
context of development work, to our social responsibilities and duty of care, and to practical limitations on what we
can achieve. The premises are outlined and explained [here](https://www.developsense.com/blog/2012/09/premises-of-rapid-software-testing-part-1/){:target="_blank"}.

- How RST is Different from “Factory-Style” Testing? Rapid Software Testing differs from "traditional" approaches to
testing. [Here](https://www.satisfice.com/download/how-rst-is-different-from-factory-style-testing){:target="_blank"} are several ways in which that plays out.

# Automation
- Paul Holland and I did a keynote called “[automation addiction](https://youtu.be/ZcwxzvGWFc0){:target="_blank"}”. Where we talk about what bad practices we see in automation in testing and how to improve. 

# Testing Story

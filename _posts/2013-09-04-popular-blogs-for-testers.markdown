To help the Dutch community evolve to learn, think and do more skilled testing I want to advocate interesting stuff to read to the community. But what should a tester read? Earlier I published [a list of popular books for testers](/posts/popular-books-for-testers){:target="_blank"}. In my search for good books to read, some people replied that they only read blogs and other on-line content. On this blog I recommend great articles and on-line stuff in [my great resources list](/posts/great-resources){:target="_blank"}. For testers blogs you can check [here](/posts/great-resources/#my-favorite-blogs){:target="_blank"}.

But what do other testers recommend? My curiosity kicked in again and I sent out another email to my tester friends around the world to ask for their favourite blogs.

This is the ‚Äútop 19‚Äù of most mentioned blogs. In the list are all blogs that got more that 2 votes. I am thrilled to be in this list at all. But it must have been the ‚Äú[availability heuristic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_wkv1Gx2vM){:target="_blank"}‚Äù that got me on the 3rd place! Thanks folks üòÄ

> Thanks Huib, you helped not only the Dutch community ,but the rest of the world as well=)

<code style="color : lightskyblue">Pete Walen - September 13, 2013 at 4:42 pm</code><br>

> Wow! I made Huib‚Äôs list of blogs! deeply honored ‚Äì Now I better get back to writing. (Inbetween the day job stuff).

> I made it onto the full list of blogs so I dont want to appear bitter but‚Ä¶

> Some of the blogs on the list rarely get updated ‚Äì testobsessed for example hasn‚Äôt blogged since December 2012 and Cem blogs once in a blue moon. Did people just vote for the name or for the blogs they really read? What is the definition of ‚Äòpopular‚Äô?

<code style="color : lightskyblue">Huib Schoots - September 6, 2013 at 9:00 am</code><br>

>> Good question. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ You should ask them, but I think it also has something to do with ‚Äúavailability‚Äù üòÄ

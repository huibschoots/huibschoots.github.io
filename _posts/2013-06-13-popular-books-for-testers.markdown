I love to read and I own many books on testing, software, management and other stuff that relates to my work.

But what should a tester read? On this blog I recommend several books in [my great resources list](/posts/great-resources){:target="_blank"}. And what do other testers recommend? My curiosity kicked in and I sent out an email to my tester friends around the world.

<blockquote class="prompt-info">Every year the Dutch association for software testers TestNet organizes two one-day conferences. This year TestNet has chosen context-driven testing as the theme for their autumn event in October. To help the Dutch community evolve to learn, think and do more skilled testing I want to advocate some interesting books to the community. Here I need your help! Please send me your personal top 10 of best books testers should read. It can be any book, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a book on testing‚Ä¶ I will collect the submissions and create a list of most popular books amongst testing professionals. Please send me your list of favourite books! Hope to hear from you soon.</blockquote>

One of the testers replied that he could not send a list. ‚ÄúWhat you should be reading depends on what you are ready to learn about next, and that varies from person to person‚Äù. And I agree with this statement. This list of books can be useful when used as a list to inspire. Another tester replied: ‚Äúthe reading that has been most helpful in my career has been centered around blogs and twitter far more than it has been around books‚Äù. For testers blogs you can check my colleagues list. Maybe creating a list of most popular testers blog will be my next project üòÄ

> Thanks for the list of great books!!
There are many in there that I haven‚Äôt even heard of which look good.

> I‚Äôm quite surprised that none of Ed De Bono‚Äôs books made it into the top 8 though‚Ä¶
His ‚ÄúLateral Thinking‚Äù books is an essential read for any tester!

> And these are just ‚Äútesting‚Äù books. The thing about testing ‚Äì as I believe James Bach alludes to ‚Äì there are a lot of parallel fields which also support and develop strength which are useful to our development as testers.

> One such book that comes to mind is What Do You Care What Other People Thing by Richard Feynman which is an amazing voyage into a scientific critical thinking and how the Challenger disaster happened because people were complacent.

> Likewise Between Silk And Cyanide taught me a lot. It is the autobiography of an SOE cryptographer during WW2, who has constantly to educate his superiors on the risk of the coding and decoding they‚Äôre doing. His managers find his arguments abstract so rubbish him. So instead he needs to find ways to get his technical message over to them (and sometimes be down right subversive to serve a greater good).

In the October edition of Testing Trapeze my experience report “[How I became a rapid software testing trainer](/assets/files/How-I-became-RST-trainer-TestingTrapeze-2015-October.pdf){:target="_blank"}” is published. It has been an amazing journey! When I started this journey, I thought it would be much easier. It was a lot of hard work, a struggle sometimes, but it was totally worth it! A journey in which I learned a lot about myself and the testing craft. I am looking forward teaching the next class in December in the Netherlands this year! See you there?

Testing Trapeze was a free high quality testing magazine from Australia and New Zealand, advocating good testing practices.

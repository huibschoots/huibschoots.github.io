I know, I am way too late to wish you a happy new year. But I wish you a very happy new year anyway! This year will be a very busy one for me. To create some overview for myself, I created a mindmap of my testing ambitions for 2012…

This truely will become a magnifiant year! Busy but awesome for sure. Some highlights:

- Together with DEWT colleague [Peter](https://simonsaysnomore.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank} I am going to [Test Coach Camp](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/cast-archive/test-coach-camp/){:target="_blank} and [CAST 20120](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/cast-archive/cast-2012/){:target="_blank} in San Jose USA. Still have to send in some proposals this week(end).
- I am doing talks at Czech Test and Let’s Test Conference
- I am finally going to do the [BBST training: foundation](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/bbst-black-box-software-testing-courses/){:target="_blank}, but maybe bug advocacy also.
- DEWT colleague Jean-Paul and I will try to get a tutorial at the [Agile Testing Days](https://agiletestingdays.com/){:target="_blank}
- Will do a lot of writing: a book for TestNet on the future of software testing, a column for agile record, columns for testnieuws.nl and testnewsonline.com and my own blog. And if I can find some more time I’ll try to get something published in Testing Planet.

And another DEWT peer conference to look forward to! A lot of testing, conferencing, meeting and learning to do!

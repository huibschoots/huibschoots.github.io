## How I make Impact

Hi! I'm Huib Schoots, based in Den Bosch, the Netherlands.

I'm passionate about learning, mindset, behavior, collaboration, testing, and software quality. As a consultant,
trainer, and coach at Sogeti, I help organizations, teams, and individuals create valuable software. I am one of four
Rapid Software Testing teachers.

My personal mission is to elevate software quality by empowering teams and organizations through problem solving,
connection, innovation, facilitation, coaching, enabling, and teaching.

And I like making lists!
